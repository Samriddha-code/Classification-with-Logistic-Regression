# Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression

## Overview  
This project uses logistic regression to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign based on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.

## Data Preparation  
- Dropped irrelevant columns (`id`, `Unnamed: 32`).  
- Converted the diagnosis column to binary: malignant = 1, benign = 0.  
- Split data into 80% training and 20% testing sets with stratification to maintain class balance.  
- Standardized features using `StandardScaler`.

## Model Training & Evaluation  
- Trained logistic regression on scaled data.  
- Evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
- Default threshold (0.5) gave precision ~97.5% and recall ~92.9%.

## Threshold Tuning  
- Explored thresholds from 0 to 1.  
- Selected threshold 0.4 improved recall to ~95.2% while keeping precision ~97.6%.  
- This reduces missed malignant cases, important for medical diagnosis.

## Sigmoid Function

Logistic Regression uses the sigmoid function to convert the model's output into a probability between 0 and 1.

The sigmoid function, denoted Ïƒ(z), is calculated as:

sigma(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))

Here, exp(-z) means "e" (Euler's number) raised to the power of negative z, where z is the weighted sum of input features.

This function "squashes" any real number to a value between 0 and 1, which represents the probability that the input belongs to the positive class.

## How to Use  
1. Load and preprocess data.  
2. Split and scale features.  
3. Train model.  
4. Perform threshold tuning and evaluate metrics.  
5. Visualize results with precision-recall curves and ROC curve.

## Tools  
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
